# hello-world
I'm new and open to learn.
Hi I'm Ian and I just created this account to get started in coding and machine programming.

I'm currently a fresh undergrad from Malaysia and looking to self study coding and web-development, which I find much more fascinating than my current degree in Economics and Finance. I hope that one day I will be able to write apps and program like a pro! (as well as working everywhere around the world :))
